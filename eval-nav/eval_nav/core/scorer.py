"""Backward-compatibility shim for the legacy V1–V4 scorer API.

New code should use ``eval_nav.core.scorers.get_scorer(task_type, scoring_version)``.

This module re-exports the new classes under the old names so that any
existing call-sites continue to work without modification:

    from eval_nav.core.scorer import get_scorer, V1Scorer, V4Scorer

Legacy single-argument ``get_scorer("v4")`` is still accepted via the
``_LEGACY_MAP`` below, which maps old version strings to the closest
equivalent scorer class.
